Commonly used testing checklists
Functional (black-box) checklists contain checks for dominant functions of the complete system or for the definite functions of the lower levels.
System elements checklists (white-box) examine sub-systems and modules of higher levels as well as special data items at secondary levels.
Structure/feature checklists path through various aspects such as the list of customers and producers for definite sources or units sharing some average data, etc.
Properties checklists test fixed values such as definite specification units, code systems, etc.

Advantages of using checklists in testing
Checklist-based testing is widely used by QA experts advocating for its convenience and productivity. Their knowledge and experience form the base for performance testing of a high quality. Main reasons to use this type of tests are:

Flexibility. This kind of checking can be used in all testing types.
Easy to create. It is not difficult to create, use and maintain a checklist.
Analyzing the results. Checklists are easy to follow and examine.
Team integration. The checklist can be ready-made guidance and help new testing personnel to integrate into work.
Deadlines control. This type of testing helps to control test accomplishment and not to miss some critical bugs before the deadline.
Difficulties of using checklists in testing
Different interpretation. QA engineers with various backgrounds can accomplish identical tasks using different approaches.
“Holes” in coverage. It is difficult to capture all functional or structural components, especially those of higher levels.
Item overlap. Trying to cover a big scope of material there may be a duplication of the same information. This can lead to excessive testings.
Reporting problems. Complex system components, functions, and their interaction are difficult or even impossible to illustrate, applying checklists.
